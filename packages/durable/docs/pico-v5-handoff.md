# Pico5 implementation handoff

`packages/durable/docs/pico-v5.md` is normative. Implement this list in order.
After every package: run its tests, run `npm run check`, and stop for user review.
Do not redesign later packages while implementing the current one.

Pico3 is reference material only. Preserve useful behavior, not its capability
facades, membranes, document routing, view projection, events, or clone chains.

## Status

- Obsolete `pico` and `pico4` prototypes were removed.
- `pico3` remains.
- Packages 1–12 are implemented in `packages/durable`; Package 10 was already satisfied by Chord's canonical structural diff implementation.

## 1. Records, cursors, and memory tables

Implement IDs, sequences, reserved root conversation ID `1`,
`ConversationRecord`, `EntryRecord`, strict input/write `SubmissionRecord`
values, live/terminal `TaskRecord` values, document records, storage writes, backend-opaque JSON cursors, and
detached `MemoryStorage` tables.
Reserve `Conversation` for the public conversation object, `Entry` for the typed
entry definition, and `Task` for the typed executable definition returned by
`defineTask()`.

Test reserved root identity and immutable creation, mixed atomic commits,
rollback, detached reads/writes, cursor boundaries,
fork-aware entry scans through deep ancestor caps, head lookup,
entry-to-commit lookup, full task replacement, and submission replacement/
request-ID lookup.

## 2. Memory document records

Add selected document base/delta writes, retirement, reincarnation,
current/as-of membership, exact logical-address lookup, scoped scans, and
materialized point-in-time reads. Storage keeps base/delta revisions private and
returns a detached value plus its stored definition version. It applies Chord
`Op[]` directly and receives no definition callbacks or unused candidate values.

Test Session-, conversation-, and task-scoped documents, half-open lifetimes,
create-plus-retire, retired historical membership, family queries, current-only
reclamation, version boundaries, detached ownership, and no scans of unrelated
document records.

## 3. SQLite backend

Implement the complete storage contract with ordinary rows and indexed document
records. Do not translate Chord operations into SQL JSON patches.

Run the memory conformance suite after reopen. Test SQL transaction rollback,
recent/ancient as-of reads, query plans, latest reclamation, WAL checkpointing,
deleted-page reuse, and representative storage sizes.

## 4. JSONL publication

Implement table writes in `main.jsonl`, one document sidecar per incarnation,
one sidecar per live task, and one main marker per commit. Do not add a
standalone-sidecar protocol.

Copy, rather than import, the current `ExecutionEnv`, `FileSystem`, `Shell`, Node
implementation, and their required utility files from `packages/agent/src/harness`
into `packages/durable/src/env`. Copy only the environment-related slice, not
agent skills, prompts, telemetry, or tool definitions. Extend the copied
filesystem contract with exact-byte file truncation and file flushing. JSONL
depends only on `FileSystem`, not the broader `ExecutionEnv`. Keep the portable
environment and JSONL entry points free of Node built-ins; expose Node
implementations only from `/env/node` and `/storage/jsonl/node`. Do not use the
Pico3 implementation as source material.

Refactor the current `MemoryStorage` state machinery into a two-phase prepared
mutation: validation and detachment produce a candidate that can later be
applied without failure. Build `MemoryStorage.commit()` on that pair, and reuse
the same machinery for JSONL. JSONL must append every prepared sidecar record,
append the main marker, and only then apply the prepared in-memory mutation.
Serialization or preparation failure occurs before file I/O and does not poison
the backend. Retained indexes/materializations remain detached from write
arguments, and reads never expose backend-owned cached objects.

JSONL creation has `fsync?: boolean`, defaulting to `false`. With `false`, append
sidecars and then the marker without an explicit flush. With `true`, append all
affected sidecars, flush each affected sidecar, and then append the main marker.
Do not explicitly flush `main.jsonl` for ordinary publication. A main-only commit
has no sidecars to flush. Any uncertain publication append or flush failure
poisons the open backend and publishes no prepared in-memory mutation. Package 5
adds the separate post-publication flush required to authorize reclamation.

Fault-test torn/short sidecar writes, failures between sidecars, every marker
boundary, unconfirmed tails, missing confirmed data, poisoned writes, exact-byte
tail truncation, both fsync settings and their call ordering, detached retained
state and reads, and browser-safe portable entry points. Run the complete storage
conformance suite directly and after reopen.

## 5. JSONL reclamation

Implement task-document retirement and current-only base reclamation using
committed markers and descriptor invalidation. Remove a sidecar directly when no
records remain; otherwise use temporary replacement and rename. With `fsync:
true`, flush `main.jsonl` once before destructive reclamation so the authorizing
marker cannot disappear while cleanup survives; if that flush fails, skip
reclamation without failing the already-published commit. Flush a non-empty
temporary replacement before rename. This is not publication flushing or main
compaction.

Crash-test every rewrite/rename boundary. Verify that rewindable history is
never reclaimed and default no-fsync behavior matches the specification.

## 6–7. Tracker transaction core, definitions, and typed access

**Prerequisite:** `@earendil-works/chord/delta` exports the canonical
Astra-immutable-optimized `track`, `Tracker`, `Change`, and `Prepared`, and its
draft placements reject values that are not strict JSON.
Experimental variants under other Delta directories are not Pico APIs.

Implement these packages as one milestone. Keep the implementation layers
separate, but do not build a temporary untyped document-acquisition seam.
Implement the generic `Tx` table surface these tests require: exact table reads,
paginated conversation/entry/task scans, `ReadAfterWrite`, ID-creating writes,
and full task replacement. Scans expose the Storage cursor and caller-selected
limit; they never hide an unbounded full scan. Semantic
conversation, entry, task, and scheduler behavior remains in Packages 13–17.

Keep one Astra-immutable tracker per loaded document. Its trusted immutable
`value` is the current shareable revision. `prepare()` emits detached
self-contained operations and computes the next revision with the optimized
immutable applier; operation placement payloads and that revision may share
containers, and neither may be mutated. `adopt()` validates ownership and
revision, then only pointer-swaps to the already-computed value.

Implement scope-preserving singleton/family tokens and overloads for Session,
conversation, and task owners. Only `tx.doc()` is get-or-create: singleton tokens
supply `initial()`, while family calls always supply key and seed and use only the
first seed when absent. Definitions are explicit typed arguments, not registered
declarations; conflicting definitions claiming one persisted kind are
unsupported caller misuse.

On first `tx.doc()` access, memoize the acquisition promise by logical address
before awaiting it, then call `tracker.beginChange()`. Repeated access returns the
same overlay draft for the whole possibly async Session callback. The Session
line permits only one open change per tracker. A callback that settles with an
unresolved acquisition rejects: seal `Tx`, abort open changes, drain and abort
the pending acquisition, and observe its failure. Callback failure aborts every
change. Callback success prepares every change before Storage admission.

Do not walk prepared operation payloads or selected bases for strict JSON; they
are strict JSON by construction. Tracker branding and revision checks enforce
ownership and staleness. Evaluate each staged document write exactly once and
pass Storage only the selected base value or operation batch. Keep every previous immutable revision unchanged through Storage
settlement. On success, adopt every prepared value by pointer swap and enqueue
its immutable revision/operations publication before releasing the line. On
Storage failure, abort prepared changes, poison the Session, and publish nothing.
Preparation failures roll back normally; Package 8 adds checkpoint selection and
its failure path.

Initializer, migration, and replacement roots are copied into exclusive kernel
ownership with a strict-JSON check before becoming trusted immutable revisions.
Loaded and fork-copy roots come detached from Storage and are tracked without
another copy. Chord copies and strict-JSON-checks every draft placement and
throws at the offending assignment. Astra empty batches suppress
ordinary writes, while replayable nonempty structural no-ops remain valid writes
and publications. No runtime freezing or second operation-payload copy is
required.

Snapshot, source, and watch lookup never create and return `undefined` when
absent. `snapshot()` returns the shareable immutable current revision; callers
must copy before mutation. A read-only migration may cache its migrated immutable
tracker together with the older stored-version marker, without writing; the next
successful `tx.doc()` still writes the required current-version base.
Transaction-staged creation or migration enters the shared cache only after its
enclosing Storage commit succeeds. All cold loads run on the Session line; a
loaded immutable revision may be read without copying.

Test callback failure; escaped-draft revocation at callback settlement; concurrent duplicate
acquisition; callback failure and success with a pending acquisition; late
acquisition after sealing; concurrent initialization once; initial bases; family
first-seed wins; scope/token mismatch; non-creating reads; shared immutable
snapshots and stable prior revisions; empty-batch suppression and replayable
redundant structural no-ops; multi-document preparation failure; uncertain
Storage failure poisoning; old-revision stability through Storage settlement;
pointer-swap and replacement adoption; operation/revision payload sharing under
the trusted no-mutation contract; non-JSON initializer and draft-placement
rejection; assignment copying and repeated-placement
independence; authority and prepared-draft non-escape; terminal-task rejection;
task-derived conversation identity; retirement; reincarnation-bound sources;
and unload/reload. Include create-task-then-document,
document-after-terminal rejection, and create-document-then-terminal settlement
in one transaction; internal candidate validation must not trigger
`ReadAfterWrite`.

## 8. Checkpoints and migration

After tracker preparation, Session evaluates `checkpointWhen(value, ops)` exactly once
for ordinary mutations and sends Storage only the selected base or delta.
Implement required creation/version bases and lazy all-older-version migration
on typed access; Harness open does not scan ordinary documents.

Test read-only in-memory migration, `tx.doc()` migration rollback and coalescing
with later edits, rewindable migration on current/historical read, the first
successful `tx.doc()` version base even without a JSON change, newer-version
rejection, migrated state/watch hydration without a write, subsequent operations
against that migrated baseline, stored-version fork copying, unaccessed and unavailable-definition
preservation, predicate failure rollback before Storage admission, and checkpoint
starvation without backend heuristics.

## 9. Conversation document forks

Using fixture conversations and entry-to-commit mappings, implement the `asOf`,
`current`, and `initial` settings for singleton and family documents.

Test opaque stored-version copying without definitions, retired membership, new
child incarnations, later lazy migration, lazy `initial` creation, and exclusion
of task- and Session-scoped documents.

## 10. Chord structural array operations

**Chord-owned prerequisite/integration:** the canonical Astra-immutable operation
generator must encode compact replayable array changes; Pico only verifies and
consumes it.

Improve the canonical generator so ordinary positional mutations encode
scattered removals without carrying retained payloads. Callers must not write
operations manually.

Test front/tail/middle/scattered/all/no removal, retained 256 KiB and 1 MiB
payloads, append plus removal, later nested/index writes, exact replay, unchanged
previous immutable revisions, and equality between Astra's prepared candidate
and immutable operation replay. One prepared document change remains one Session
commit; no intermediate candidate is adopted or published.

## 11. Chord document state

Use Chord's existing `ReplicatedStateSource` attachment contract internally, but
expose one already-attached read-only `DocumentState` per acquisition. It must
atomically hydrate in O(1) from the current immutable revision and publish later
exact committed immutable value/operation frames without another tracker, value
copy, or re-diff. Disposal unregisters that one state. Pico remains the sole
document mutator.

Test contiguous Chord delivery sequences, atomic hydrate/subscribe, a baseline
that covers queued publication without duplicate application, exact value and
operation reference sharing, retirement to `null`, incarnation-bound recreation,
independent state disposal, migrated hydration, definition-free fork copies,
tracker-cache unload, and trusted mutation footguns.

## 12. Document watches

Implement non-creating `watchDoc` as an incarnation-bound `WatchHandle` that
returns `undefined` when absent and atomically captures the current immutable
revision in O(1) while registering for later exact committed frames. Before
`start()`, its value remains the acquisition revision. After start, invoke one
serialized asynchronous listener with each exact value and operation batch,
advancing `watch.value` immediately before the callback. Preserve commit Context
values without inheriting producer cancellation.

Retain at most 100 pending frames, excluding the in-flight callback. Adding frame
101 replaces the complete undelivered suffix with one root replacement carrying
the newest exact immutable revision and Context. Do not estimate serialized
bytes, call `JSON.stringify()` for accounting, copy values, replay operations, or
re-diff revisions.

Test updates between acquisition/return/start; exact values and operation
references; no callback overlap; listener-initiated commits; commits during an
in-flight callback; overflow before start and behind an active callback;
retirement folded into an overflow reset; replayable redundant structural
commits; delivery Context value preservation; retained earlier revision
stability; trusted mutation footguns; retirement before start and while active;
recreation; idempotent stop; second-start rejection; cancellation during
acquisition; cancellation/close during a callback without aborting or joining it;
listener-error settlement; and invocation-owned cleanup in package 14.

Packages 13–20 are vertical milestones. Each must leave one real public path
working end to end; do not defer all integration to the last package.

Cross-cutting constraints for these milestones:

- Introduce each persisted built-in document kind once, with its final schema,
  history/fork policy, migration, checkpoint predicate, and public mount path.
  Record that concrete protocol in the normative specification when the kind
  lands. Do not add temporary built-in kinds or later replace a fake schema.
- Keep all visible progress durable. Tests may use faux models and fake effects,
  but production code must use pi-ai's exported `Models` interface and the real
  task chain; do not add a Pico model adapter or production fake successor.
- Prepare every loaded `ConversationView` revision from the complete candidate
  Session commit before Storage admission. Never rebuild a view by subscribing
  to already-committed table/document publications.
- A milestone may leave later operations unimplemented, but it must not expose a
  temporary public facade. Extend the final §2.2 objects as later behavior lands.

## 13. Openable Harness

Implement the first usable slice of the final §2.2 surface:
`Harness.open/close`, stable root creation and lookup, conversation lookup and
creation, concrete-entry forks, `onConversation`, conversation-bound `commit()`
and `entries()`, and generic inherited Session document APIs. Implement the
public `Entry` definition token and `Conversation` handles rather than adding an
intermediate capability facade.

Bring conversation and entry semantics up to the normative contract: explicit
ownership, fork-aware cursor pagination, head lookup, entry edits, and model
context derivation. Context reduction includes newest-edit wins, positional PR
#9548 `SystemMessage` replay, tool-result ordering, missing post-fork tool
results, excluded stop reasons, and separate raw-history/model-context results.

Define the final rewindable/as-of conversation configuration document now. It
contains model selection, default `"off"` thinking, ordered section values, and
active tool names. Implement every configuration getter/setter and atomic
configuration seeding/override needed by root, independent conversation, and
fork creation. Definitions supplied through final Harness options may be used
for section/tool identity validation; dynamic execution and hooks arrive later.
Do not create temporary fixed document accessors.

Use an internal final-form bootstrap transaction for reserved root ID `1`; do not
expose a temporary root-creation API or split empty-storage root/config creation
across commits. `options.root` applies only to empty storage. For this milestone,
Harness open/reopen acceptance is explicitly limited to storage with no live
tasks. Package 14 removes that limitation by adding complete open-time task
reconciliation; Package 13 must not invent partial reconciliation behavior.

Acceptance: open persistent storage, obtain the root, mutate configuration and
history through public handles, create and fork conversations, close, reopen,
and verify stable root/conversation identity and state. Test atomic root and
conversation/config creation; actual forks; deep ancestor caps; same-commit
entry prefixes; cursor boundaries; self-head resolution; newest-edit wins; raw
head-to-tail transcript versus model context; model-less and excluded assistant
entries; replacements/omissions; multiple heads; section replacement/removal/
re-addition order; integer-like section-key rejection; positional tool changes;
missing post-fork results; every configuration getter/setter; explicit active-
tool duplicate/unregistered rejection; default active registry snapshot; as-of
configuration inheritance including unavailable historical names; seed
overrides; listener initial/future delivery and isolation; and reopen.

## 14. Durable task runtime

Implement `defineTask`, exhaustive phase maps, full checkpoint replacement,
kind migration, runtime commits and memos, invocation lifetime gates, scheduler
reservation, dependencies, terminal outcomes, typed waits, holds, quiescence,
joins, and orphaning. Complete the task-facing §2.2 methods: `resume`, `suspend`,
`hold`, task-kind registration, `getTask`, `waitForTask`, `markTask`,
`abortTask`, and the task-aware portion of idle waits.

Include the execution-critical abort core: durable direct-task marks,
signal-and-join of an active run, fresh abort invocation, run-commit rejection
after a mark, and close precedence. Deep owned-subtree cascading and background
boundaries remain Package 18. Open now reconciles every surviving `running` task
to `pending`, migrates registered kinds, and atomically orphans unknown or
unmigratable live kinds as required by the normative specification. No handler
dispatches during open, and dynamic registration does not resurrect a task
settled by that pass.

Use a fake two-phase external effect to test the real runtime. Acceptance is an
intent/effect/outcome task interrupted after intent, closed, reopened on the same
storage, and safely resumed to a durable terminal receipt. Also test unchanged-
checkpoint faulting, same-phase progress, cancellation precedence, thrown
handlers, dependencies, result values and entry IDs, first-writer-wins memos,
terminal checkpoint/memo removal, task-document retirement, close/reopen without
abort marks or fabricated outcomes, no fresh phase/abort dispatch while closing,
watch cleanup, holds and quiescence with eligible work, unknown kinds, mark-only
versus signalling abort, and crashes at every direct-task abort stage.

## 15. First runnable no-tool chat turn

Implement the smallest real input-to-answer vertical path. Define the final
inbox, turn-control, and generation presentation documents needed by this path;
do not use provisional kinds or schemas. Add input `Submission` admission,
request-ID deduplication, reacquisition and waiting, idle placement, active-turn
ownership, successful answer settlement, and terminal failure cleanup. Expose
the final `SubmissionDraft` union rather than an interim input-only API. Complete
the optional initial input path on conversation creation so conversation,
configuration, sections, and input admission commit atomically. Busy steer/
follow-up behavior, passive writes, and reset remain Package 17.

Implement section registration and no-tool request preparation, including exact
persisted rendered strings, positional system baselines/deltas, head-cut
rebaselining with `ContextEdit` omissions, and preparation revision checks.
Implement the ordinary generation phases needed for one response: preparation,
request intent, durable throttled partials, attempts/retry classification,
deferred handle polling/cancellation, assistant entry settlement, and input-
submission completion.

Call pi-ai only through its exported `Models` methods: `getModel()`,
`streamSimple()`, `fetchDeferred()`, and `cancelDeferred()`. The test double must
implement that same interface; production code gets no adapter. A missing configured model produces
the durable `no_model` failure. All progress exposed to observers is committed
state, never raw provider frames.

Acceptance: `Harness.open → root → resume → submit(input) → Submission.wait →
durable assistant answer → close/reopen`, using faux Models in tests. Exercise
interruption and reopen before/after every implemented generation phase,
aborted-partial conversion, deferred polling/cancellation, retryable and
terminal model errors, no-visible-undurable updates, exact section order/value
patches, complete post-head baselines, retained system deltas on both sides of a
head marker, atomic input/
configuration/section creation, and durable submission settlement. This is also
the first print-mode smoke path: print awaits its own input submission rather
than global idle.

## 16. First coding-agent tool turn

Implement task/tool registries and Session/owned-subtree hooks, then wire the
real generation → tool tasks → post-tools → generation chain. Implement offered-
set checks, declaration and argument validation, hook composition, durable
execution intent, stored replay policy, bounded stream/progress documents,
result entries, post-tools joining, controls, and `postTools`/`final` boundaries.
The generation task now classifies tool calls and continues through the real
built-in task chain; neither side uses a production fake successor.

Implement runtime registration lifetimes and preparation behavior for tool
loadout additions/removals, same-name replacement ordering, complete baseline
tool declarations, hook memos, and configuration/registry revision retries.
Do not implement in-process replacement of executing Session-side extension
code; the normative v1 close/reopen boundary remains Package 20.

Acceptance: input → model tool call → registered local read/bash/edit operation →
tool result → model answer → durable submission settlement. Run that path once
normally and once interrupted/reopened. Test recovery from every tool and post-
tools phase; offered-history enforcement; before/after hook rules; both stored/
current replay-policy directions; default and overridden output bounds; streamed
content fallback; progress replacement and coalesced commit settlement; drain-
before-terminal ordering; abort/close with buffered output; invocation-bound
handles and watches; `missing_active_tool` settlement; atomic assistant/tool/
post-tools commits; and all registry lifetime and positional tool-history cases.

## 17. Live UI and product state

Complete submissions and inbox behavior: busy `steer`/`followUp`/`reject`,
passive writes, withdrawal, ordered `postTools`/`final` selection, stale targets,
self-head cuts, successor turns, queued reset/handoff, and every terminal cleanup.
Successful inputs still require an answer; writes settle on placement and never
start generation.

Define any remaining built-in preference/presentation documents once with final
schemas. Implement the structural `{ conversation, entries, docs }`
`ConversationView`, `viewState()`, and `watch()`. Build the first revision lazily
on the Session line. For each affected commit, derive and prepare one mounted
operation batch from the complete candidate transaction before Storage
admission; after success, only install prepared pointers/cursors and enqueue the
exact immutable frame. Do not derive the mount through `subscribeCommits()`.

Add the §9.4 notification adapter directly from uncoalesced committed
publication, without another tracker or persistence authority. Wire TUI
hydration to structural state/watch, print to its own `Submission`, and JSON/RPC
to correlated commands plus ordered committed notifications. Transport
backpressure and disconnect policy stay in the mode adapter.

Table-test every submission transition, cross-type request-ID conflicts,
interleaved queue selection, compact positional removal of large payloads,
abort results, reopen waits, writes pending without a later boundary, busy reset
placement, and orphan/fault cleanup. Test one view publication per Session
commit; atomic entry/preview settlement; parent-linked active entries and heads;
mounted create/recreate/retire; preparation rollback before Storage; empty-batch
suppression and redundant nonempty revisions; contiguous delivery; stable public
paths; O(1) immutable acquisition; structural sharing; serialized consumers;
bounded reset behind an in-flight callback; durable retry/tool/collapse status;
output truncation metadata; the documented placement of diagnostics in entries,
terminal details, or bounded state; asynchronous consumer initialization; and
absence of semantic projection. Verify watch overflow cannot erase a separately
subscribed notification lifecycle, late clients hydrate structurally, and
notifications expose committed throttled
progress rather than raw provider frames.

## 18. Ownership and subagents

Complete the remaining owned-conversation and abort semantics: durable foreground
subtree cascades, signal/join/fresh-abort across ownership edges, background
boundaries, ordinary and full traversal, conversation abort, and exact idle
waits. Finish invocation-bound owned APIs used by tools and the foreground and
background subagent provisioning patterns, including atomic task/conversation/
registry creation and request-ID-safe submission recovery.

Test deep ownership trees, owner edges after terminal settlement, nested
background boundaries, conversation abort/join with surviving passive writes and
background tasks, cancellation of waiters without cancellation of work, and
atomic cancellation intent. Test default non-inheritance, inheritance from the
current committed tail, empty source conversations, document fork policies,
explicit model/section/tool seed overrides, foreground subagent cascade, and
background supervisor recovery before and after submission admission.

## 19. Collapse and overflow

Implement manual, threshold, and generation-overflow collapse; exchange-boundary
range selection; summarization; retry policy; staleness checks; and headed
summary entries. Wire generation's real overflow path directly to the collapse
task, and complete `Conversation.collapse()` so it returns the admitted task ID.

Test model context before and after collapse, raw history preservation, provider
failure, declined and stale work, manual/threshold/overflow admission, late-join
presentation state, and reopen from every phase. Rerun generation overflow
integration without a fake collapse kind.

## 20. Reload and final conformance

Complete any remaining §2.2 surface and lifecycle gates, then implement the
normative v1 host-extension reload path: stop admission/reservation, close and
join, dispose registrations/facets, rebuild over the same storage with new
definition tokens and task/tool/section definitions, reopen/migrate live tasks,
and resume. Ordinary documents migrate on later typed access. The separate live-
registries proposal remains non-normative unless it is first merged into
`pico-v5.md`; do not silently substitute it for §7.4.

Test that close seals commit and mutation admission, lets already-admitted
storage settlement finish despite caller cancellation, stops future state/watch
delivery, joins task/tool/hook invocations outside the Session line, writes no
abort or terminal outcome, starts no fresh abort invocation, and never runs old
and new Harness generations concurrently. Include cancellation during watch
acquisition and an already-running callback that remains caller-owned across
shutdown. Verify service withdrawal and client detach.

Run the exhaustive public conformance matrix: stable persisted root identity;
all root/create/lookup/fork/reset/collapse/abort/idle paths; every configuration
getter/setter and fork override; typed input/write submissions; task wait/abort;
generic document access; task/tool/section registration between open and resume;
conversation listener isolation; structural watches; and no resurrection of a
task settled during open. Compile-test every §2.2 and §3 owner/key/seed overload,
the normative usage sequences, and the Chord guide. The erased registry test must
use a concrete narrowed-input task with multiple checkpoint phases and custom
hooks. Verify that a Chord root-replacement delta remains distinct from a
Session-selected storage checkpoint.

Run all package-specific tests and the repository check. Finish with a local
coding-agent turn and a reopened interrupted turn through the public Harness,
then stop for final review.
