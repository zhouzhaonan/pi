# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial release of `@earendil-works/pi-env`: `RemoteExecutionEnv`, a Durable `ExecutionEnv` on another machine, and `Connection` to the `pi-env` daemon that runs there. Results match `NodeExecutionEnv` on that machine on Linux, macOS, Android and Windows. The daemon watches files natively (polling on Windows and network file systems), honors output windows so dropped command output is not transferred, and keeps control replies ahead of bulk output; watchers report `overflow` and resume after a lost connection.
- SSH bootstrap: `connectSsh` detects the remote system, deploys the daemon this package ships for it (verified by SHA-256 before it runs), and connects; `scanHostKey` and `acceptHostKey` manage trusted host keys.
